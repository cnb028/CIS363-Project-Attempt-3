                            embedding a youtube playlist that can be updated with more videos and classwork. Hoping to redo some old assignments
                            as live videos just so I can have better videos for my future employers to look at.

                            This upcoming course is based around business applications, which is extremely exciting for me! I love the
                            idea of building business applications since it means I'm a step closer to creating apps in general.

                        <p>As the seasons change, so to do my classes. With an excited spark, I finish out this session. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Ironically, Fall is known as the season of change. I do feel like a lot has changed since my last update to this portfolio.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I appreciate all the time and dedication my professor has put into this course, I have a cool new site to show for it. However, this isn't the only thing
                            I have to show for the Fall. I've learned how to endure more this past term as well how to enjoy what life throws at me. Fall, I guess, isn't just a season of change
                            but also a season of gratitude. I hope next term I learn more and grow.

                        <p>The term is slowing down as I finish my finals and focus on making this site the being I want it to be. While this is only my first draft,
                            I am very proud of what I am creating. Hopefully it will evolve into something that I can have and work on for years to come.</p> 
                            <br>
                            <p>Thank you to
                            everyone who has allowed me to get this far. My professors have been really generous and kind, and I've learned a lot taking their classes.
                            Especilly this last term since I found a love for making websites and playing with Machine learning software. I'm hoping next term to learn
                            even more about creating webpages since I know this has some work it needs.</p>

                        <p>
                            Once more, I would love to thank everyone who has assisted me in this endeavor. I hope my business can grow as I grow into a better programmer
                            with the knowledge and skills to make people very happy.</p>

                            While I am aware it will be a lot of work solo, I hope as I grow, the company grows as well.<br /> I want this to be a small business since it will
                            be a <br /> side business to help me get experience in the long run for joining bigger companies. <br />
